HarryShop SQL Capstone Project

Project Overview

HarryShop is a SQL capstone project that simulates a real-world e-commerce database system. The goal of this project is to design a structured relational database and perform business analysis using SQL queries.

This project shows how SQL is used in real organisations to manage customers, products, orders, and payments, and how businesses extract insights from data to make better decisions.
